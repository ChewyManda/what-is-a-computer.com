                        <p class="card-text text-center my-4"> • The functions of a computer typically include the following tasks: taking data, processing it, returning results, and storing it. Let's explore each of these functions in more detail:<br>

                            1. Input: Computers can take data or input from various sources. This can include keyboard inputs, mouse movements and clicks, voice commands, sensor data, or information from external devices such as scanners, cameras, or microphones.<br>

                        <p class="card-text text-center my-4"> 2. Processing: Once the computer receives the input data, it performs various operations on it. This processing involves executing instructions and algorithms, manipulating and transforming the data, performing calculations, 
                            <br>making decisions based on predefined conditions, and executing software programs. The central processing unit (CPU) is responsible for carrying out these operations.
                            
                            3. Output: After processing the data, the computer generates output to convey the results to the user. This output can take various forms, such as<br> displaying text, images, or videos on a screen, producing sound through speakers, printing documents, or transmitting data to other devices or networks.
                          <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

Storage: Computers have the ability to store both input data and processed information for later use. <br>This is typically done in different types of memory or storage devices. Random Access Memory (RAM) is used for temporary storage during program execution, while long-term storage is provided by devices such as hard disk drives (HDD), solid-state drives (SSD), or cloud storage.
                
                            These four functions are essential for the operation of a computer system. They enable computers to accept data from various sources, process it using algorithms and instructions,<br> produce meaningful results or output, and store information for future use. This basic framework forms the foundation for the wide range of applications and tasks that computers can perform in our daily lives, from word processing and web browsing to complex simulations, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

                            <strong>CPU</strong>
                        </h3>
                        <p>•Central Processing Unit (CPU), principal part of any digital computer system, generally composed of the main memory, control unit, and arithmetic-logic unit. It constitutes the physical heart of the entire computer system; to it is linked various peripheral equipment, including input/output devices and auxiliary storage units. In modern computers, the CPU is contained on an integrated circuit chip called a microprocessor. 

                            <br><br> •The control unit of the central processing unit regulates and integrates the operations of the computer. It selects and retrieves instructions from the main memory in proper sequence and interprets them so as to activate the other functional elements of the system at the appropriate moment to perform their respective operations. All input data are transferred via the main memory to the arithmetic-logic unit for processing, which involves the four basic arithmetic functions (i.e., addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and certain logic operations such as the comparing of data and the selection of the desired problem-solving procedure or a viable alternative based on predetermined decision criteria. The CPU is the brain of a computer, containing all the circuitry needed to process input, store data, and output results. It can constantly follow the instructions of computer programs that tell it which data to process and how to process it. Without a CPU, we could not run programs on a computer.

                            <strong>GPU</strong>
                        </h3>
                        <p>•A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a computer chip that renders graphics and images by performing rapid mathematical calculations. GPUs are used for both professional and personal computing. Traditionally, GPUs are responsible for the rendering of 2D and 3D images, animations and video -- even though, now, they have a wider use range.

                            <br>  <br>•In the early days of computing, the central processing unit (CPU) performed these calculations. As more graphics-intensive applications were developed, however, their demands put a strain on the CPU and decreased performance. GPUs were developed as a way to offload those tasks from CPUs and to improve the rendering of 3D graphics. GPUs work by using a method called parallel processing, where multiple processors handle separate parts of the same task.
                            
                            <br> <br>•GPUs are well known in PC (personal computer) gaming, allowing for smooth, high-quality graphics rendering. Developers also began using GPUs as a way to accelerate workloads in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI).
                            
                            <br> <br>•Today, graphics chips are being adapted to a wider variety of tasks than originally designed for, partially because modern GPUs are more programmable than they were in the past.
                            
                            <br><br>Some examples of GPU use cases include:
                            
                            <br><br> • GPUs can accelerate the rendering of real-time 2D and 3D graphics applications.
                            
                            <br><br>• Video editing and creation of video content has improved with GPUs. Video editors and graphic designers, for example, can use the parallel processing of a GPU to make the rendering of high-definition video and graphics faster.
                            
                            <br><br> • Video game graphics have become more intensive computationally, so in order to keep up with display technologies -- like 4K and high refresh rates -- emphasis has been put on high-performing GPUs.
                            
                            <br> <br> • GPUs can accelerate machine learning. With the high-computational ability of a GPU, workloads such as image recognition can be improved.
                            
                            <br><br> • GPUs can share the work of CPUs and train deep learning neural networks for AI applications. Each node in a neural network performs calculations as part of an analytical model. Programmers eventually realized that they could use the power of GPUs to increase the performance of models across a deep learning matrix -- taking advantage of far more parallelism than is possible with conventional CPUs. 
                            GPU vendors have taken note of this and now create GPUs for deep learning uses in particular.
                            
                            • GPUs have also been used to mine bitcoin and other crypto currencies like Ethereum.

                        </h3>
                        <p>•The computer case serves mainly as a way to physically mount and contain all the actual components inside a computer, like the motherboard, hard drive, optical drive, floppy disk drive, etc. They typically come bundled with a power supply.

                            <br><br>•The computer case itself can be constructed from any material that still allows the internal devices to be supported. This is usually steel, plastic, or aluminum but might instead be wood, glass, or styrofoam.
                            
                            <br><br>•Most computer cases are rectangular and black. Case modding is the term used to describe the styling of a case to personalize it with things like custom internal lighting, paint, or a liquid cooling system.
                            
                            <br> <br> •The front of the computer case contains a power button and sometimes a reset button. Small LED lights are also typical, representing the current power status, hard drive activity, and sometimes other internal processes. These buttons and lights connect directly to the motherboard, which is secured to the inside of the case.
                            
                            <br><br>•Cases often contain multiple 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch expansion bays for optical drives, floppy disk drives, hard drives, and other media drives. These expansion bays are located at the front of the case so that, for example, the DVD drive can be easily reached by the user when in use.
                            
                            <br><br> •At least one side of the case, perhaps both, slide or swing open to allow access to the internal components. See our guide on opening a computer case for instructions, or see what the inside of a PC looks like.
                            
                             •The rear of the computer case contains small openings to fit the connectors contained on the motherboard, which is mounted inside. The power supply is also mounted just inside the back of the case, and a large opening allows for the connection of the power cord and use of the built-in fan. Fans or other cooling devices may be attached to any and all sides of the case.

                            <strong>KEYBOARD</strong>
                        </h3>
                        <p>•A keyboard is a peripheral device that enables a user to input text into a computer or any other electronic machinery. A keyboard is an input device and is the most basic way for the user to communicate with a computer. This device is patterned after its predecessor, the typewriter, from which the keyboard inherited its layout, although the keys or letters are arranged to function as electronic switches. The keys include punctuation, alphanumeric and special keys like the Windows key and various multimedia keys, which have specific functions assigned to them.

                            <br><br> •There are different types of keyboard layouts manufactured based on the region and language used.
                            
                            <br><br>•QWERTY: This layout is the most widely used and is named after the first six letters that appear on the top row. This layout is commonly manufactured today because of its popularity. It is so common across the world – even in countries that do not use the Latin-based alphabet for their language – that some people think that it is the only kind of keyboard there is.
                            
                            <br><br> ~AZERTY: This was developed in France as another variation to the QWERTY layout and is considered the standard French keyboard.
                            
                            <br><br> ~DVORAK: This layout was created to reduce finger movement when typing and produce faster typing speeds than QWERTY or AZERTY.</p>

                            <strong>MONITOR</strong>
                        </h3>
                        •A monitor is an electronic output device that is also known as a video display terminal (VDT) or a video display unit (VDU). It is used to display images, text, video, and graphics information generated by a connected computer via a computer's video card. Although it is almost like a TV, its resolution is much higher than a TV. The first computer monitor was introduced on 1 March 1973, which was part of the Xerox Alto computer system.

                        <br><br>•Older monitors were built by using a fluorescent screen and Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), which made them heavy and large in size and thus causing them to cover more space on the desk. Nowadays, all monitors are made up by using flat-panel display technology, commonly backlit with LEDs. These modern monitors take less space on the desk as compared to older CRT displays.

                        <br><br>History of Monitors

                        <br><br>• In 1964, the Uniscope 300 machine included a built-in CRT display, which was not a true computer monitor.

                        <br><br>• A. Johnson invented the touch screen technology in 1965.

                        <br><br>• On 1 March 1973, Xerox Alto computer was introduced, which had the first computer monitor. This monitor included a monochrome display and used CRT technology.

                        <br><br>• In 1975, George Samuel Hurst introduced the first resistive touch screen display, although it was used only before 1982.

                        <br><br>• In 1976, the Apple I and Sol-20 computer systems were introduced. These systems had a built-in video port that allowed them to run a video screen on computer monitor.

                        <br><br>• In 1977, James P. Mitchell invented LED display technology. But even 30 years later, these monitors were not easily available to buy in the market.

                        <br><br>• In June 1977, the Apple II was released, allowing for color display on a CRT monitor.

                        <br><br>• In 1987, IBM released the IBM 8513, first VGA monitor.

                        <br><br>• In 1989, VESA defined the SVGA standard for the display of computers.

                        <br><br>• In the late-1980s, the color CRT monitors were able to support 1024 x 768 resolution display.

                        <br><br>• Eizo Nanao manufactured the Eizo L66, the first LCD monitors for desktop computers, and released it in the middle-1990s.

                        <br><br>• In 1997, the color LCD monitors were started developing by IBM, Viewsonic, and Apple that provide better quality and resolution than CRT monitors.

                        <br><br>• In 1998, the color LCD monitors for desktop computers were manufactured by Apple.

                        <br><br>• Later in 2003, CRT monitors outsell for the first time by LCD monitors. Till 2007, CRT monitors consistently outsell by LCD monitors, so they become more popular computer monitor.

                        <br><br>• In 2006, Jeff Han released the first interface-free, touch-based monitor at TED.

                        <br><br>• In 2009, the LED monitor MultiSync EA222WMe was released by NEC company. It was the first monitor released by NEC.
AMD and Intel announced to end support for VGA in December 2010.

<br>• In 2017, touch screen LCD monitors became more affordable for the customers as they started to decrease the price.
